	The requirement for the design have to be simplistic.

	It is meaning no animation nor too much fancy/color to the front menu.

	Also, keeping the menu and buttons as organize as possible.

	Will this app be a static or dynamic? The app will be dynamic but the content that we will be pulling from, its will be static.

	We will be relying on third party UI library for our design layout. 

	For ex. We can use multiple library rather building our own. This way to reduce development time and avoid bugs. 

	In order to make this app a multi platform we will use the React Native.

	It is a JavaScript Framework that allows us to create a truly native app that doesnâ€™t compromise the user experience.

	Within this Framework there is an Expo toolkit that will allow us to test the product.

	The main language is JavaScript. It is commonly use language that is easy to understand and most of our team is familiar with it. 

	It is also allow I.T. and follow on teams to pick up the language with low learning curve.

	For mobile responsiveness, we have to consider  how the app will support  older mobile operating system.

	(For ex. Will it support all the way back to older android version or iphone4, iphone5 or iphone6?) This requirements is still in discussion with our sponsor.

 	Also, we  have to take in consideration on how to make it responsive when changing screen sizes.

 	(For example, phones have many/variety of sizes and changing from tablet or ipad. 
	
	We have to consider how to make it display and scale correctly for each devices.)

	For back end development I will pass this to Sriram.
