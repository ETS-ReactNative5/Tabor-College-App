# Tabor-College-App
### Setting up the development environment
1. On your git bash window or terminal on Mac, run `git clone https://github.com/Falzaro/Tabor-College-App.git` to clone the Tabor-College-App repository from Github.
2. Then run `cd tabor-college-app` to go to the project directory.
3. To view the app using expo, execute `npm start`.

### Opening the app on your phone

1. Once you run `npm start`, a new tab opens up in your browser. 
2. On the left panel, change the connection from "LAN" to “Tunnel”. This is where you can view, test, and debug the mobile app. To see the app, make sure that you have "Expo Go" installed on your phone.
3. On your iPhone, scan the QR code with your default camera. You can now view the UI of the app. If you are using an android phone, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Projects" tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.
